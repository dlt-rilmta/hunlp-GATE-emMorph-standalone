# The Original README.md content

This directory should contain the binaries and the Hungarian HFST transducer file to run hfst.

To get the binaries read the README.md in your operating system's directory.

The `hu.hfstol` transducer file should be obtained separately by [running `complete.sh`](https://github.com/dlt-rilmta/hunlp-GATE#method-2-for-developers) (on Linux).

The source for hsft-ol is available from here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/hfst/

The source for hsft-wrapper is inside the hfst-wrapper directory.
