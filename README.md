This directory should contain the binaries and the Hungarian HFST transducer file to run hfst.

To get the binaries read the README.md in your operating system's directory.

The `hu.hfstol` transducer file should be obtained separately by [running `complete.sh`](https://github.com/dlt-rilmta/hunlp-GATE#method-2-for-developers) (on Linux).

The source for hsft-ol is available from here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/hfst/

The source for hsft-wrapper is inside the hfst-wrapper directory.
